Active learning workflow for MPCAs using MD simulation tool MeltHEAS for optimized melting temperatures
Active Learning Workflow for MPCAs
Active learning (AL) can drastically accelerate materials discovery and its power has been shown for a variety of materials and materials properties. In this tool, we couple active learning wiith molecular dynamics simulations to identify multiple principal component alloys (MPCAs) with high melting temperatures. We present a fully autonomous workflow for the efficient exploration of the high dimensional compositional space of MPCAs.
