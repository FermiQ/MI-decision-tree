    "# Introduction - Predicting High Entropy Alloy Properties with Machine Learning\n",
    "<b> nanoHUB tools by: </b>  <i>Mackinzie S. Farnell, Zachary D. McClure</i> and <i>Alejandro Strachan</i>, Materials Engineering, Purdue University <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In these tutorials, we train a neural network to predict the relaxed vacancy formation energies, cohesive energies, and local atomic pressures and volumes of atoms in a high entropy alloy. The inputs to the neural network are unrelaxed bispectrum coefficients and central atom descriptors queried from Pymatgen. These neural networks can calculate local atomic properties of relaxed structures based on unrelaxed bispectrum coefficients, which can reduce the need for computationally expensive relaxation calculations. The model is trained using equiatomic CrFeCoNi, and tested on CrFeCoNi of varying compositions and on CrFeCoNiCu. We also identify one use of the models in predicting relaxed vacancy formation energies to calculate fractional vacancy occupancies.\n",
